Two main measures for the efficiency of an algorithm are
Processor and memory
Complexity and capacity
Data and space
Time and space
The time factor when determining the efficiency of algorithm is measured by
Counting microseconds
Counting the number of statements
Counting the kilobytes of algorithm
Counting the number of key operations
